The grinning voice of John Denver caroling "Rocky Mountain High" may never again seem quite so innocent once you've consumed "Final Destination," the leaden teenage horror film in which the song is repeatedly used to announce the arrival of death (with a capital D).
The first time you hear the anthem by the perky folk-pop singer, who died in a plane crash, it is being piped over the sound system at Kennedy Airport minutes before Alex Browning (Devon Sawa), a jittery high school senior, is to board a jet for Paris on his class trip. For weeks, Alex has been having premonitions of disaster, and as he quakes with terror in a men's room stall, the Denver song sneaks into the background to taunt him with the reminder that what goes up must come down.
Once on the plane, Alex is seized by a fantasy (the movie's scariest scene) in which the aircraft, seconds after takeoff, shudders with a death rattle as an explosion rips through the cabin, creating pandemonium. Berserk with panic, Alex snaps out of his nightmare and screams that the plane is going to crash, even though it still hasn't left the gate.
Escorted back to the terminal, he ends up one of seven who stay behind. When the plane carrying most of his classmates finally takes off and seconds later explodes in midair, killing everyone aboard, Alex is shattered but not surprised.
The disaster and Alex's premonitions set up a heavy-handed fable about death and teenage illusions of invulnerability. Having cheated death, Alex and his six fellow survivors discover that the Grim Reaper is in a major snit. And for the rest of the movie, it sets about picking them off, one by one. But if you imagined that death would dispatch them as quickly and efficiently as possible, think again. Being a teenage horror film, "Final Destination" is not about to let anybody go gentle into that good night.
